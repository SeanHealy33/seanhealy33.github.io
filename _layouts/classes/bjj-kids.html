          <p class="mb-4 text-justify">At Athlete A, our Kids BJJ program is designed to help children develop physical skills,
            mental strength, and valuable life lessons through the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Our classes are tailored
            to different age groups and skill levels, ensuring that every child receives the attention and guidance they
            need to thrive.</p>
          <p class="mb-4 text-justify">Our experienced instructors create a fun, safe, and supportive environment where kids can
            learn, grow, and build lasting friendships. Through BJJ, children develop discipline, respect, confidence,
            and problem-solving skills that will benefit them both on and off the mats.</p>
