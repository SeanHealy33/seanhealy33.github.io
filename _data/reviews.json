I had never done BJJ before and the beginner classes are great and give me the necessary information and practice to progress my techniques. The environment is amazing too. Everyone is kind, respectful and always ready to help. I really recommend this place if you are thinking about start practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. #OSS"
